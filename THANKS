Thanks to Tim 'Scytale' Weber ( http://scytale.name/ ) for the Levitation
idea and Python prototype. He kicked off the plan to convert Wikipedia to
an infrastructure around a DVCS.

Thanks to the git community, git coders, git documenters etc.

Thanks especially to Shawn Pearce for his excellent git-fast-import program
around which Levitation is centered. The source was very inspirational for my
own (stupid) version of it.

Thanks to Tim Bunce, Adam Kaplan et al. for Devel::NYTProf. If you're coding
Perl, want to have an efficient program and need a way to profile, this is the
way you _must_ take. I wish every programming language had such a profiling
tool.

Thanks to the nice folks on the #levitation channel at FreeNode IRC.
