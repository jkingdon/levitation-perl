This is a Perl port of scy's levitation. It reads MediaWiki dump files
revision by revision and writes a data stream to stdout suitable for 
git fast-import.

The first 1000 pages of the german Wikipedia and all their revisions
(about 390000) can be dumped in about 35 min on relatively moderate
hardware.

You need at least Perl 5.10 and the TokyoCabinet libraries plus
their Perl bindings.

You need libxml2 compiled with Reader and Pattern support

You need the following modules and their dependencies from CPAN:

- XML::LibXML
- Regexp::Common


Have fun.
