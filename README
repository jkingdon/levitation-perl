This is a Perl port of scy's levitation. It reads MediaWiki dump files
revision by revision and writes a data stream to stdout suitable for 
git fast-import.

The first 1000 pages of the german Wikipedia and all their revisions
(about 390000) can be dumped in about 15 min on relatively moderate
hardware.

You need at least Perl 5.10. The Perl interpreter has to be compiled
with threads support.

You need the following modules and their dependencies from CPAN:

- XML::Bare
- Regexp::Common
- Inline
- JSON::XS
- CDB_File


Some Linux distributions will already have the first four.
Under Debian / Ubuntu the following command should set you:

  sudo apt-get install libxml-bare-perl libregexp-common-perl \
                       libinline-perl libjson-xs-perl



Have fun.
